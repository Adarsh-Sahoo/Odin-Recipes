    <h1>Butter Naan</h1>
    <img src="../images/images.jpeg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter naan is basically comfort wrapped in warm, pillowy bread. It’s that soft, slightly chewy flatbread that arrives at the table still steaming, with those beautiful blistered char marks from the tandoor—like little freckles from the fire.</p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250 gram flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda></li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon grated garlic</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon melted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup yogurt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup luke warm milk</li>
        <li>4-5 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Kalonji Seeds (optional)</li>
        <li>Little bit of Coriander Leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add 2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour, 1½ teaspoon baking powder, 1½ teaspoon baking soda, ½ teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons sugar & 1 to 11½ teaspoons grated garlic (optional) to a large mixing bowl. If you prefer to use yeast please check the instructions in the recipe card.</li>
        <li>Give the dry ingredients a good stir. Then pour 2 tablespoons oil or melted butter, 1½ cup yogurt and ¼ cup + 2 tablespoons luke warm milk.</li>
        <li>Begin to knead the dough adding more warm milk as needed. You may need more water or milk than mentioned in the recipe.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough very well until soft & pliable. It must be soft & not sticky. Do not over knead as it will make tough naans.</li>
        <li>Cover and rest for 30 mins to 1 hour. This is optional. I make them instantly after 10 mins. Divide the dough to 6 parts and make round balls tucking the edges inside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile chop 4 to 5 garlic cloves and ½ cup coriander leaves. Melt 3 tablespoons butter and set aside all of these along with kalonji seeds (optional).</li>
        <li>Flour the rolling area very lightly. Too much flour will toughen the naans. Place a dough ball and flatten it.</li>
        <li>Roll or stretch the dough to a oval or a elongated shape. Sprinkle the toppings and then lightly roll it again. You can make all the naans. They will shrink and become smaller, just roll again while you cook them.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or tawa. If the pan is not hot enough then the naan will not rise well. So ensure it is hot but not extremely hot. Gently remove the naan from the counter and place it on the hot griddle. Soon you will see bubbles on the naan. You can also cook them covered</li>
        <li>Hold the naan with a tong and filp it to the other side. After flipping you can cook them on the griddle or on direct gas flame as per your preference. Cook on the other side as well until completely cooked & slightly charred. Do not press down the naan with a spatula as it will make them dense.</li>
        <li>For ease you may place a wired rack on your stove to toast them on the other side. Here I placed a wired rack over the electric stove and flipped it to cook on the other side. I used a electric stove (hotplate) which has a cast iron plate over it.</li>
