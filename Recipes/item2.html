 <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>Palak Paneer is one of those dishes that feels like a warm, comforting hug in a bowl. At its heart, it’s a rich, velvety spinach curry that gets its depth and complexity from slow-cooked spinach, pureed until it’s silky smooth. The spinach itself, vibrant and fresh, takes on a darker, almost earthy quality once it’s sautéed with onions, garlic, ginger, and a touch of aromatic spices like cumin, coriander, and garam masala. There’s something about that perfect balance of savory, slightly bitter greens with the warmth of the spices that makes it a dish you want to sink into.</p>
