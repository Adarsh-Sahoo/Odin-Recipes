    <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>Kulfi is like the love child of ice cream and a warm hug, but it’s got this special charm that makes it stand apart. Imagine rich, full-fat milk slowly simmering away until it’s thick and creamy—almost like a custard but with a deeper, more indulgent feel. Then, you throw in a little saffron for that golden touch and a sprinkle of cardamom to keep it from getting too sweet. The result is this dense, creamy frozen treat that melts slowly, like it’s in no rush to leave you.</p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>

        <li>1 ¼ cups evaporated milk</li>

     <li>1 ¼ cups sweetened condensed milk</li>

     <li>1 (16 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>

     <li>4 slices white bread, torn into pieces</li>

     <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
